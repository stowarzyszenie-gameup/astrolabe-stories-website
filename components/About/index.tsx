          Astrolabe Stories is a gaming project of Gamesâ€™ Development and
          Research Association GameUP. The main aim of Astrolabe Stories is to
          make meaningful games with unforgettable stories. We are a group of
          experienced storytellers and enthusiasts of story design. Just as the
          astrolabe showed the direction of travel, for us such a way of
          navigating is telling unique stories. With a group of our students, we
          decided to start our journey together and make our first game
        </p>
        <p className=" text-white">
          Each of us appreciates games with stories that touch the heart and
          make us think about life. That is why we want to create stories that
          will leave a mark on players&apos; memories.
        </p>

          &quot;Last Threshold&quot; is our first game, heavily inspired by the
          work of H.P. Lovecraft and his followers, which allows you to learn
          about the extraordinary history of a mysterious temple in Siberia. We
          decided on the visual novel genre because we wanted the player to
          empathize with the hero struggling with the dark secrets of the
          temple, difficult weather conditions, and his own past.
        </p>

        <p className=" text-white">
          Now we are working on new projects, in which we want to focus on
          telling the stories of protagonists, whose fates will allow us to tell
          a bit more about human nature and much more! You will have to wait a
          little longer for more information. Stay tuned!
